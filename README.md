## Quick start

```sh
# install the Gatsby CLI globally
npm install -g gatsby-cli
git clone https://github.com/Ji4n1ng/blog.git
cd blog/
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Todo

Because the construction of this site is still not completed, there will be some strange problems, such as mixed Chinese and English, no pagination. So the experience is not friendly. Features such as multi-language support and paging will be updated in the future, but it should not be in the short term.

- Pagination
- Multi-language Support
